### LiveRender

  Automatic updating is provided by LiveRenders.  Each LiveRender has two functions: `prepare` and `update`.
    
### prepare(templateName, data)

called when the HTML is initially rendered. return the HTML for the initial page load.

`this` is the current RenderContext.

### update(event)

called when the server sends an event about data. modify the current page.

`this` will have the properties:

 * `elementId`: id of a wrapper div automatically inserted around the output of your `prepare` function
 * `element`: jQuery('#'+elementId), cached for performance 
 * `templateName`: the same templateName that was passed your `render` function
 * `objId`: contains the value of data.id





### RenderContext
  the scope that all compiled templates and render functions are attached to (`this` in a template refers to a RenderContext.)
  
### ViewBindings
  { element, template, object, updater} objects that are automatically added to the RenderContext when renderLive is calle
