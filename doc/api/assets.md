## Assets

Assets are the static files that are served to the browser in support of your application.

In production, your assets should be distributed by a CDN and be reduced in size and quantity (minification & concatenation.)

Transitive will support all of these steps in the workflow.

For now, Transitive supports the sharing of code with the browser using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).
