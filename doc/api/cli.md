## CLI

Currently, there is no CLI for the Transitive framework itself, but you can override server options by passing the options as arguments. Ex: `node server.js --port=8080`. For more information, please see [options](options.html).


### Dump options

You can dump the options by setting the `dumpOptions` configuration parameter to true.  To do this with command-line overrides, start your server with: `node server.js --dumpOptions`

### Generator

I would accept a patch that would include a CLI for generating the project structure and stubs.
