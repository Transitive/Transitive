### Reviewers

Several people have reviewed various drafts of the original documentation. Dedicating their time to read my various drafts and scoff at some inane experiments, I would like to especially thank:

 * Scott Bronson
 * Jeffery Freeman
 * Irvin Owens

### Colophon

The build and styling was taken from `node.js` core and modified to add support for diagrams and tweak the css a bit. Made with `markdown`, `make`, `graphviz` and the horizontal rule `<hr/>`.

`doctool.js` and the CSS were taken out of the Node source code and are covered by its (MIT) license, and are (c) Joyent and other Node contributors.  I have included their license in all relevant files.

tools/doctool/markdown.js is copyright 2009-2010 Dominic Baggott and Ash Berli and released under the MIT license.
    
### Building the documentation

clone the source, `make doc`. Requires ghostscript, graphviz and a recent version of node (~0.4.7).  Will output to build/ directory.
