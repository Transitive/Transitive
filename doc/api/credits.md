Special thanks to Jeffery Freeman, Scott Bronson, Irvin Owens, and everyone else that has given me feedback and direction.

### Colophon

The build and styling was taken from `node.js` core and modified to add support for diagrams and tweak the css a bit. Made with `markdown`, `make`, `graphviz` and the horizontal rule `<hr/>`.

### Building the documentation

clone the source, `make doc`. Requires ghostscript, graphviz and a recent version of node.  Will output to build/ directory.
